#STANDARD TYPE HIERARCHY:It introduces all type of built-in types from other languages can define additional types.

#it describes all type of data and they can be divided by parts of different category. So that Based on type of data and its value, their operations can be bounded.

#For Instance: Let us consider type of data are Numbers are supported for all arthmetic operations when string literals only support concatenation(additon) operation.

#Basically type of data as assigned it automatically shows supported operations on console by dot operator(embeded)as object attributes(behaviours) and methods(characteristics)

#It also includes some of added datatypes from extension modules in other languages.

#Here Standard Type Hierarchy is a list of types discussed below one by one:

#Binary Sequence Types: these are 4 types: #1.Bytes 2.Bytearray 3.Memoryview 4.Buffer Protocol 5.Array

#1.Numbers: These are 3 different types in Python based on the values

#1.Integral 2.Real(Float) 3.Complex

#Integral: these are again 2 types: 1.Integer 2. Boolean

#2.Sequences(Iteration Types): these are also called data collections for supporting data especially, it represents finite order sets of items seperated by comma as listed below:

#Sequences are mainly 2 types: 1.Immutable 2.Mutable sequences

#1.Immutable sequences: An object of Immutable sequence type never changes once it has been created

#Immutable sequences are 4 types: 1.Numbers 2. Text sequence Types 3. Tuples 4. Bytes

#Text Sequence Types: 1. Strings 2. Bytes

#Mutable sequences: An object type of mutable sequence can change even after creation

#Mutable sequences are 4 types: 1.List 2.Byte array 3.Set type 4.Mapping type

#3.Callable Types: These are the types to which the fuction call operation can be applied

#Callable types : These are 2 types: 1. Fuctions 2. Classes

#Callable types of objects have Attributes and Methods

#Instance Methods: An instance method object combines a class, a class instance and any callable objects (Functions)

#Attributes and Methods: Pre-defined and User-defined attributes and Methods

#Type Descriptors: these are also called Special attributes for Desription of fuction objects but they not intended for general use

#NOTE: Most of Attributes are Writable to check type of assigned value

#NOTE: Functions also can be objects in python, created by function definition. it has special attributes, methods and Special Method Names

#Special method name:

#Customization: 1.Customizing attribute Access 2. Customizing Module attribute Access

#Instance Methods:

#NOTE: Attributes and Methods: 1.User-defined(readable) 2. Pre-defined(Writable)

#1. Functions: Functions are callable objects in Python. 1. Built-in 2. User-defined Functions

#Buit-in Fuctions: these also callable with supported arguments such as print(), len(), etc....

#Note: Buit-in Fuctions have buit-in Methods similarly for user-defined functions also

#User-defined Functions: User-defined Functions are callable with arguments. these are defined by user with def Keyword

# User-defined fuctions are 4 types: 1. Normal fuctions 2. Generator Fuctions 3. Coroutine Fuctions(Awaitable Objects) 4. Asynchronous Generator Fuctions 5.Asynchronous Context Managers

#2.Classes: A Class is a callable object. these objects normaly act as factories for new Instances of themselves but variations are possible for class types

#Class type is created by Class definition. A class has a namespace implemented by a dictionary object

#Parts of Class:

#1.

#Customization: Customizing Class Creation

#Special Method Lookup:

#Note: Class object combines Class instances, Attributes and Methods like Functions(Callable objects)

#4.Modules: Modules are important type of standard hierarchy, it is a basic unit of python code and created by Import system

#Modules 2 types: 1.Buit-in Modules 2. User-defined(third party)Modules (for advanced Implementation)

#5.Input/Output types: These are also known as File Objects. it represents open file by using buit-in functions to create objects

#6.Internal Types: A few types used internally by interpreter are exposed to user. these are different types discussed below

#1.Code types: it represents byte-compiled executable python code or bytecode

#2.Frame types: it represents Execution frames. it occurs in traceback objects and also passed to registered trace functions

#Traceback Objects: it represents a stack trace of an exception. it is implicitly created when exception occurs.

#3.Slice types: slice objects created by buit-in function used to represent slices for particular objects like string,List etc....

#Slice objects have special read-only attributes: 1.start(lower bound)2. Stop(upper bound) and Step(step value), these can have any type

#Static Method Objects:


#7.Context Manager types: It is a type of an object defines the runtime context to be established when executing WITH statement

#NOTE: The context Managers normally called using WITH statement

#Other Built-in Types: 1. None 2. NotImplemented 3. Ellipsis
