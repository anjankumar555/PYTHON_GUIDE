#To Demonstrating the Syntax of identifiers:
#variable names using only single characters 'a' through 'z' or only 'underscore' and printing on console output.
a=2;print(a)
#only using underscore as variable name and it holds a value.
_=64;print(_);print(a+_)
#variable names using one or more characters and underscore at a time in program.
#lc_letters(names)is single or group of characters along with one or more underscores is highly recommended for declaring variable names.
a=3;a1=4;variable_name1=10;variable_name2=20;variable_name3=30;variablename4=40;_variable_name5=50;variable_name_6=60
print(a,a1,variable_name1,variable_name2,variable_name3,variablename4,_variable_name5,variable_name_6)
#variable name is group of characters or it may be anything of your choice.
cat_1=2;cat2=6;cat3_1=5;print(cat_1,cat2,cat3_1)
#Identifiers may be all upper or lowercases,titlecase,modifier letters.
#especially '*' must not used as identifier.
VAR=10;var=20;Var=8;vAR=89;print(VAR,var,Var,vAR)
#Identifiers all defined by Unicode standard Annex.
#variable name followed by one or more underscores of your choice at first or last place.
_cat=4;_=3;cat_2_1=1;lc_letter=9;lc_letter1_0_1=85968;print(_cat,_,cat_2_1,lc_letter1_0_1)
#printing all variable by print function on console as well.
#note:variable names can repeat throughout program but not their values.
var_1_0=8;print(var_1_0)
#assigning another value to the same variable name(overriding method)is possible in PYTHON.
var_1_0=9;print(var_1_0)
print('Identifiers of values printed successfull')
#NOTE:Identifiers are just names given to the Literals in PYTHON and that name is bound to a value while declaradtion.
